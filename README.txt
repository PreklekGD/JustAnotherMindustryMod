- New ore! Tin is used to make Bronze. I made it default so u dont have to make new map with placed ores :)
- Copper Rustifier: Creates scrap from copper and water. #scrapisgood
- Bronze Crucible: Creates Bronze from Copper and Tin (so realistic XD)
- Hydraulic Drill: Very slow drill that can only mine when water is in. As i said, slow but can mine nearly every ore.
